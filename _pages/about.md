Hi I'm Greg! I'm currently a 3rd year at UCLA studying computer science. I like to build software that solves problems and proves useful to people. I'm also interested in designing faster, more efficient hardware. 

In my free time I enjoy a few hobbies. To keep my mind and body healthy, I do calisthenics and running. At the beginning of this fall quarter I achieved my first muscle up. I don't like running as much, but I do it anyway, about 20 miles a week. When I'm not at school I cook plant-based food for my family and I. My theme is about making plant-based meals that are high in protein and TASTE GOOD. For example, this could be a cashew-avocado based pasta with mushroom-lentil balls. It sounds funny but it'll knock your socks off if you try it.
