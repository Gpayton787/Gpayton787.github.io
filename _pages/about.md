Hi I'm Greg! I'm currently a 3rd year at UCLA studying computer science. I like to build software that solves problems and proves useful to people. I'm also interested in designing ASICs for emerging data flows. 

In my free time, I enjoy calisthenics, running, and cooking. Right now I am working on the muscle up, handstand, and a few dynamic skills. I don't like running as much, but I do it anyway. I'm training to run the LA marathon in 2025. When I'm not at school, I love cooking for my family and I. My theme is plant-based meals that are delicious and high in protein.
