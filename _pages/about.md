Hi I'm Greg! I'm currently a 3rd year at UCLA studying computer science. I like to build software that solves problems and proves useful to people. I'm also interested in designing faster, more efficient hardware. 

In my free time, I enjoy calisthenics, running, and cooking. This fall quarter, I achieved my first muscle up and am currently working on the handstand. I don't like running as much, but I do it anyway, about 20 miles a week. When I'm not at school, I love cooking for my family and I. My theme is plant-based meals that are delicious and high in protein. For example, this could be a cashew-avocado-based pasta with mushroom-lentil balls. It sounds funny, but it'll knock your socks off if you try it.
