Hi I'm Greg! I'm currently a 3rd year at UCLA studying computer science. My interests include human computer interaction and applications of recent advancements in software and hardware in all domains. My career goal is too identify problems and solve them.

In my free time I enjoy calisthentics, running, and plant-based cooking. Right now I'm working on getting my first muscle up. I'm also going to run the LA marathon in 2025. As for cooking, my theme is making plants the star of the show (shout out Adria from five star chef). I've been eating mostly plant-based for a over a year and I've never looked back. There are so many amazing plant-based dishes that are high in protein, full of nutrition, and taste good.
