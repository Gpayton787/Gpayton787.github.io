There's a joke that goes like this: How do you know if someone's vegan?

As a vegan^*^ myself, I found this pretty funny. Choosing to cut out meat completely from your diet is a drastic lifestyle change, especially if you've been eating meat all your life, as was the case for me. To make this commitment and have any chance of sticking to it, it's vital to understand WHY you want to do this and what you want to get out of it. If your WHY isn't solid enough, you'll be back to eating chicken wings in not time.
